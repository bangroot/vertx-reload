Java Application project template
------------------------------------

You have just created a basic Java application. There is a standard project
structure for source code and tests.

In this project you get:

* A Gradle build file
* A standard project structure:

    <proj>
      |
      +- src
          |
          +- main
          |     |
          |     +- java
          |
          +- test
          |   |
